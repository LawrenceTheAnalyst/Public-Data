**Project Roadmap Summary**
●
The project aims to address challenges in the African insurance market, such as affordability and lack of insurance knowledge, with a goal to increase insurance penetration in the region.
●
The project will leverage data analysis and visualisation tools like Github, Skyvia, and Power BI to gain insights from insurance data and develop a viable solution.
●
The roadmap is structured around a framework that includes four key phases: Gather, Analyse, Deploy, and Explain. Each phase involves specific tasks and deliverables that contribute to the overall project objective.
●
A calendar timeline outlines estimated durations for each project stage, including planning, data processing, analysis, and deployment.
●
The project flow follows an iterative approach with facilitated sessions every two weeks to guide learners through the completion of specific tasks.
